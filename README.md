# saccharides_sdf
- Structural data files for several monosaccharide/disaccharide/oligosaccharide molecules, possibly to be used as proxy for their respective polymers (polysaccharides).
- In this repository, energy minimization calculations have not be performed. The spatial structure of atoms follows representative purposes but may not match any reasonable phys-chem criterion.
